# Python tutorial code

make sure your python is version 3 or up

check version by typing in console:
```
python --version 
```

## Finding the code
in terminal or powershell, you have to use the 'cd' or change directory commands to find your code.
Use a combination of "ls" (list command) and "cd" commands until you get there.

"ls" will tell you what files or folders are in your current location in the command line
"cd <foldername>" will enter that folder from your current location
"cd .." this command will move to the previous folder or parent folder or one folder up (different ways of saying the same thing).

Note: helpful keyboard shortcut is using Tab to autofill what you're typing. like a folder named "new_folder", you can type "new" then Tab and it'll fill it

## Running the code
When you do find main.py. run it with python
```
python main.py
```

most programs run like this in the commandline
<program> <input> <input> <input>...
